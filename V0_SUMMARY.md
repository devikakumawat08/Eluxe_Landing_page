# Eluxe Landing Page - V0 Usage Summary (5-10 Lines)

## Short Notes: Vercel v0 Component Usage

**Eluxe** is a premium women's fashion landing page built using **Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Vercel v0**. All **9 core components** (Navbar, Hero, Features, Products, Accessories, Jewellery, Testimonials, Newsletter, Footer) were efficiently generated using Vercel v0's AI-powered UI generation, which provided production-ready React code with built-in responsiveness and accessibility compliance. The generated components were customized with our luxury + royalty color palette (Deep Maharaja Purple #4a148c, Champagne Gold #d4af37, etc.) and India-specific features including INR pricing, local payment methods, and culturally-aligned design aesthetics. **Vercel v0 reduced development time by approximately 65%** (from ~20 hours of manual coding to ~7-8 hours with V0 generation and customization), allowing focus on brand consistency, performance optimization, and creating two additional sections (Accessories & Jewellery). The final landing page is fully responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop), WCAG 2.1 AA accessible with semantic HTML and ARIA labels, and ready for deployment on Vercel.
